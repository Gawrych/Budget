# Budget manager

This app is a budget management tool that helps you track your income and expenses. You can create transactions, categorize them, and view statistics for different periods. You can also compare two periods, such as months or years, to see how your spending has changed over time.<br /><br />
The app also allows you to add cyclical transactions, which are transactions that repeat on a regular basis. This can be helpful for tracking things like rent, car payments or salary.<br /><br />
The transaction fragment is divided into 12 months, so you can easily see all of your transactions for the current year. This makes it easy to plan and control your cashflow.
